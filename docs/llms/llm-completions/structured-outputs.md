# Generating Structured Outputs

All [`Structured Outputs`](#) generated by the `completion` method default to using `Instructor` for its incredible prompt engineering and response parsing. 

[`xnano`](#) is an attempt to oversimply everything that I possibly can, so generating structured outputs is available using multiple methods. Note that all outputs are `Pydantic Models`, they are just passed in differently.

## Structured Outputs using Pydantic Models

```python
from xnano import completion
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Extraction(BaseModel):
    name : str = Field(description="The name of the person")
    age : int = Field(description="The age of the person")

response = completion(
    "Extract john is 20 years old.",
    response_model=Extraction
)

print(response)
```

```bash
# output
Extraction(name='john', age=20)
```

## Structured Outputs using Strings

You can define a `response_model` as a `string` or list of strings, and the LLM will generate the output as a `Pydantic Model`. This method loses the ability to use docstrings and fields for descriptions, but is a quicker way to utilize simple structured outputs.

```python
class Extraction(BaseModel):
    name : str 
    age : int 

# is the same as

response_model = ["name", "age : int"]
```

All strings not given a type using the `':'` syntax are automatically assumed to be `str`.

```python
from xnano import completion

response = completion(
    "Extract john is 20 years old.",
    response_model=["name", "age : int"]
)

print(response)
```

```bash
# output
Response(name='john', age=20)
```

## Structured Outputs using Types

As you can tell, as this page goes down; the methods lose more and more prompt context; but get simpler. You can pass in a `type` to the `response_model` argument to generate a single field structured output. __Currently lists of types are not supported__.

```python
from xnano import completion

response = completion(
    "Extract john is 20 years old.",
    response_model=int
)

print(response)
```

```bash
# output
20
```
