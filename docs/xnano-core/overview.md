# xnano-core

xnano-core is the compiled Rust extension that does the actual terminal work — rendering frames, driving the event loop, and managing effects. It ships as a separate package (`xnano-core` on PyPI) and is always installed automatically when you install `xnano`. You never import it yourself.

---

## The short version

When you write a `BaseGrid` and call `Terminal().run()`, here's what actually happens:

1. xnano converts your Python `BaseGrid`, `Field`, and `Text` declarations into a small intermediate representation — a tree of render nodes.
2. That tree gets handed to a `Session` object, which speaks to xnano-core.
3. xnano-core (Rust) renders the tree into an off-screen buffer, diffs it against what's already on screen, and emits only the changed cells.

The Rust layer also owns the event loop — blocking on input, firing tick timers, and calling back into Python for each event.

---

## What lives where

xnano-core ships two sub-packages:

| Package | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `xnano_core.rust.native` | The full ratatui / crossterm / tachyonfx surface — widgets, layout primitives, effects, event types, and raw terminal control |
| `xnano_core.core` | A thin session bridge that Python uses to start and drive a live render loop |

You'll rarely need to think about either of these. They're the engine room; `xnano` is the steering wheel.

**Python is responsible for:**

- Interpreting `Sizing` constraints (`"25%"`, `"1fr"`, `3`) and translating them into ratatui `Constraint` values
- Converting your `Text`, `Sparkline`, and other components into render nodes
- Dispatching `@on_keyboard`, `@on_mouse`, `@on_tick`, and `@on_state` hooks

**Rust is responsible for:**

- Running the event loop and frame timing
- Buffer diffing and writing escape sequences to stdout
- Visual effects via tachyonfx
